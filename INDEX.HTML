            Yuji is a fair person who truly cares for not only his comrades but anyone he views as people with their own wills, 
            despite how deep or shallow his connection to them is. He highly commends "the value of life," 
            and to this end, he will ensure that others receive a "proper death". Because of this, he believes that it 
            is morally unethical for him to take another human life, and tries to avoid any possibility of doing so unless as a last resort.

            He is also not without his more energetic and outgoing traits. 
            Such as his frequent comedic moments where he was seen alongside Nobara gushing about Tokyo and his eagerness to train 
            with Satoru Gojo or even when entertaining both Junpei Yoshino and his mother. Yuji is also highly passionate whenever he's 
            focused on achieving certain goals and being quite stubborn when confronted about them, such as when Masamichi Yaga questioned 
            why Yuji wanted to become a sorcerer. He is also quite na√Øve due to his inexperience in the world of cursed spirits and jujutsu sorcerers, 
            but is shown to be a quick learner, capable of adapting to his surroundings and picking up how to use cursed energy quickly.
